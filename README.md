## Employee Management System

### Overview
The Employee Management System, built using React, is a robust application designed to enhance task management and streamline workflow within organizations. This system allows administrators to efficiently assign tasks to employees and enables employees to manage their assigned tasks seamlessly.

### Features
- **Task Assignment by Admin**: Admins can assign tasks to specific employees, including details such as title, description, category, and deadline.
- **Employee Task Dashboard**: Employees can view tasks assigned to them, complete with all relevant details (title, description, category, and due date).
- **Task Acceptance**: Employees have the option to accept tasks assigned to them.
- **Task Completion**: Once a task is completed, employees can mark it as such.
- **Status Tracking**: Admins can track tasks based on their status: open, active, completed, and failed.

### How It Works
1. **Admin Role**:
    - Assign tasks to specific employees.
    - Monitor the status of tasks (open, active, completed, failed).

2. **Employee Role**:
    - Check for new tasks assigned to them.
    - View task details (title, description, category, deadline).
    - Accept and complete tasks, marking them as completed once done.
